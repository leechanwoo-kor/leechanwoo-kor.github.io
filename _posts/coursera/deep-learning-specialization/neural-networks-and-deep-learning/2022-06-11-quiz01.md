```
-  Larger amounts of data allow researchers to try more ideas and then produce better algorithms in less time.


4. When experienced deep learning engineers work on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
- True
- **False**
```
📌 Finding the characteristics of model is key to having good performance. Although experience can help, it requires multiple iterations to build a good model.
```

```
📌 this is the ReLU activation function, the most used in neural networks.
```


6. Features of animals, such as weight, height, and color, are used for classification between cats, dogs, or others. This is an example of "structured" data, because they are represented as arrays in a computer. True/False?
- **True**
```
📌 The data can be represented by columns of data. This is an example of structed data, unlike images of the animal.
```
- False


7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
- True
- **False**
```
📌 A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of "structured" data in contrast to image, audio or text datasets.
```


8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
- It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea -> Code -> Experiment -> Idea -> ...
- **It can be trained as a supervised learing problem**
```
📌 We can train it on many pairs of sentences x (English) and y (French).
```
- **It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g. a sequence of words.)**
```
📌 An RNN can map from a sequence of english words to a sequence of french words.
```


9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in the lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55765292/173261185-507beea7-d91a-4319-9eb0-8605ec2ffb9a.png)
- **x-axis is the amount of data, y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.**
- x-axis is the performance of the algorithm, y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.
- x-axis is the input to the algorithm, y-axis (vertical axis) is outputs.
- x-axis is the amount of data, y-axis (vertical axis) is the size of the model you train.


10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
- **Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.**
```
📌 According to the trends in the figure above, big networks usually perform better than small networks.
```
- **Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.**
```
📌 Bringing more data to a model is almost always beneficial.
```
- Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
- Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
