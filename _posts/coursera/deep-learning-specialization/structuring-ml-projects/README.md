# Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects

## ML Strategy
- Streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.

### 학습목표
- Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
- Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
- Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
- Define human-level performance
- Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
- Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset

## ML Strategy
- Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain intuition for how to split your data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning.

### 학습목표
- Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning
- Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
