## History of Databases

- Early 1960s
  - File Systems
- Late 1960s and 1970s:
  - Hierarchical model : IMS(IBM)
  - Network model : IDS(Bachman(GE))
  - Relational model : Codd (IBM, Turing Award), System R prototype
- 1980s:
  - Commercial RDBMS; Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, . .
  - QBE, QUEL, SQL; SQL becomes industrial standard later.
  - Object-Oriented DB, Object-Relational DB
- 1990 - 2000s:
  - Decision Support, Data Warehouse, and Data Mining, XML, . . .
- Recent
  - NoSQL: Big Data
