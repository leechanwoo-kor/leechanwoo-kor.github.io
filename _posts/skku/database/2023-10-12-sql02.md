# Retrieval Queries
- Basic form of the Retrieval Queries:

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/3755bcac-c7fe-4cdc-aa88-a95f3ccfec5a">

<br>

- <attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query
- <table list> is a list of the relation names to process query
- <condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query

<br>

## Simple Query : Single Table

- Retrieve the birthdate and address of employees whose sex is ‘male’ and whose salary is greater than 30,000.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/f4327d1b-57ad-46eb-8aa0-d80eb425177a">

<br>

- SELECT-clause specifies PROJECT($\pi$);
- WHERE-clause specifies SELECT ($\sigma$)
- (참고: SQL의 SELECT는 relational algebra의 $\sigma$와 다름; $\pi$ 를 의미)
- This SQL expression is equivalent to:
  - $\pi$ bdate, address ($\sigma$ (salary > 30000) AND (sex = ‘male’) EMP)
 
<br>

## Optional WHERE / Use of *

- ‘WHERE’ is optional; That means “no condition” is applied; Thus, all tuples of the table are retrieved.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/27f19793-9755-4f85-963f-e233dbbbbb1d">

<br>

- To retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples, the symbol * is used, which means all the attributes

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/3a11d9ac-c996-47c5-b360-f2e3b490a9ff">

<br>

## DISTINCT

- SQL does not remove duplicate tuples in query result: Why?
  - Duplicates removal is expensive; (Sort and elimination cost!)
  - Users want to see duplicate tuples in the result of query.
  - When aggregate function (ie., sum, avg) is applied, we need to keep duplicated tuples.
- To remove duplicates in a query result, **DISTINCT** is used.
- Q1 may have duplicate values, but Q2 does not have any duplicates.
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/faf2b653-9f59-43d6-8fb8-5011fe921c3f">
- What do think about the following query Q3?
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/4cb9f537-515c-46c8-a21f-935c9ff4307e">

<br>

## Multiple Table Query

- Retrieve SSN and age of employees who work for ‘research' dept.
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/09fcfb04-c90d-47eb-a7c2-3da426ca68c5">
- (DNO = DNUMBER) condition specifies the JOIN;
- This SQL expression is equivalent to :
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/f352a2d7-c727-4852-9814-bd27c944e73d">

<br>

- For project name ‘product X', list the project number, controlling department number, and the department manager's salary
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/525e517e-3ee1-4d1e-96fe-0829e0a24239">
- Notice that there are two join conditions
  - (DNUM = DNUMBER) relates a project to its controlling department
  - (Mgr-SSN = SSN) relates the controlling department to the employee who manages that department
 
<br>

# Rename Operation
- We can rename for both relation and attributes, taking the form;
  - old name **AS** new name
- The **AS** clause can appear in both the **SELECT** and **FROM** clause.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/9c3cbbd7-a483-455d-b4a8-b86dc3bde9d7">

<br>

## Use of Tuple Variables

- We can use **tuple** variables to refer any tables in SQL query;
- Retrieve name and dept. phone of employees who work for ‘research' dept.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/4eb1a31b-f3a7-4a38-9299-c8e085b3c5fe">

<br>

- The alternative table names e and d are called “tuple variables”
- This SQL expression is equivalent to :

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/e0da5d8b-b674-4b4d-8db7-a26283774d32">

<br>

- Tuple variables are very useful for comparing two tuples in the same relation.
- In this case, two tuple variables are given to the same relation.
- For each employee, retrieve the employee's SSN, and the name of his (or her) direct supervisor.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/ec23805e-1be0-454f-bae3-e9de3dc40878">

<br>

- The alternative table names e and s are called “tuple variables”
- We can think of e and s as two different copies of EMPLOYEE;
  - e represents employees in role of ’workers’
  - s represents employees in role of ‘bosses
 
<br>

- Retrieve SSN and names of all employees whose salary greater than Smith’s salary.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/f757959a-f4d0-4ee4-8e5d-3b8b1207dfd5">

<br>

- We can also think of e and b as two different copies of EMPLOYEE;
  - e represents in the role of employees
  - s represents in the role of employee(s) with name = ‘smith’
 
<br>

- Retrieve the names of two employees (i.e., married) who share the same address.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/5d562de8-1256-475d-98ee-b7d068287d63">

<br>

- The second condition (e1.name < e2.name) means that the name of first employee precedes the name of second employee alphabetically.
- If this condition is omitted, tuple variables e1 and e2 both could refer to the same tuple. Thus, the query result produces each employee name paired with itself.
- Question: If use “<>” instead of “< “,’ what will happen?

<br>

## Substring Pattern Matching

- SQL provides **LIKE** comparison operator for pattern matching. We describe patterns by using two special characters.
  - Percent(%): The % matches any “substring”.
  - Underscore(_): The _ matches any “character”.
- Patterns are case sensitive; that is, upper case characters do not match lower case characters, or vice versa; Some examples are;
  - ‘Blue%’ matches any string beginning with ‘Blue’.
  - ‘%idge% matches any string containing “idge” as substring.
    - Examples: Blueridge, Ridgeriver, ‘Rockbridge, Ridgeway, . .
  - ‘_ _ _’ matches any string of exactly 3 characters.
  - ‘_ _ _%’ matches any string of at least 3 characters.
 
<br>

- Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/47b01aa6-c6b1-452e-aff8-42853382f3bb">

<br>

- Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970s.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/c10813f0-a443-420d-8252-d845d9a4f5ab">

<br>

- Note that **NOT LIKE** also can be used in a similar way

<br>

# Arithmetic Operations

- We can use arithmetic operations in query; The standard operators +, -, *, and / can be applied to attributes with numeric data types;
- Show resulting salaries for every employee working for the research department is given 10% raise.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/10d948e8-ddb0-421d-a399-74a0bad99869">

<br>

- SQL provides BETWEEN operator to simplify comparison operators.
  - For example, retrieve all employees whose salary is between 30,000 and 40,000. (that is, salary >= AND salary <= 40000)
 
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/58ab7b6c-b8e8-4314-93c6-c5ee1973ffa7">

<br>

# Set Operators

- UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
- Each of the above operations automatically removes duplicated tuples;
- To retain all duplicated tuples, use the corresponding operations UNION ALL, INTERSECT ALL, EXCEPT ALL.
- Suppose a tuple t occurs m times in R and n times in S;
  - R UNION ALL S : (m + n) times occurs.
  - R INTERSECT ALL S : Min(m, n) times occurs.
  - R EXCEPT ALL S : Max(0, m – n) times occurs
 
<br>

- Retrieve SSN and name of employees with age > 40 or sex = ‘male’.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/0e7f80cb-5ac8-40fa-a3a9-00f8db258044">

<br>

- This is equivalent to :

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/72b793ca-f3bf-4ffa-881e-36a50f969ac1">

<br>

- Retrieve SSN of employees with any no dependents.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/b2daad60-cd7d-4d74-952e-1c97b31a158a">

<br>

- Retrieve all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose name is ‘Bob' as a worker, and as a manager of the department that controls the project.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/85bf6880-87f6-4787-a843-79b6a2effac4">

<br>

# NULL Values

- NULL represents missing values; It has 3 different meanings :
  - (1) Unknown (exists, but unknown):
    - Someone has ‘blood-type’, but currently is not known.
  - (2) Unavailable (exists, but is withheld):
    - Someone has ‘phone-number’ but does not want it to be listed.
  - (3) No applicable (undefined or non-existent):
    - ‘spouse’ may be NULL for unmarried someone.
- It is not possible to distinguish these 3 meanings: For example, Suppose many persons have “NULL value for phone-number”; How can we interpret this?

<br>

- Let X have the value NULL;
  - (1) Any arithmetic operation with NULL returns “NULL”.
    - X + 5, X – 5, X * 5, . . .
  - (2) Any comparison with NULL returns “UNKOWN” :
    - X < 5, X = 5, X = NULL, X <> 5, . . .
- Note that “UNKOWN” is another truth value like TRUE and FALSE.
- SQL provides IS NULL (or IS NOT NULL) for dealing NULL values;
- “X IS NULL” returns “TRUE” if X has NULL value; It returns “FALSE” otherwise.

<br>

- SQL uses a three-valued logic: TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/b8bdbe61-274b-44fc-bb91-69a57a4e6fcd">

<br>

- To understand how 3-valued logic works:
  - Let T = 1, F = 0, U = ½,
  - AND = MIN, OR = MAX, NOT(X) = 1 - X
- Example:
  - T AND (F OR NOT(U)) = MIN(1, MAX(0, (1 - ½ )))
  - = MIN(1, MAX(0, ½ ) = MIN(1, ½ ) = ½ (= U).
 
<br>

- Result of WHERE condition is treated as FALSE if it evaluates to UNKNOWN.
- Tuples that are evaluated to only TRUE are selected.
  - Thus, tuples with either FALSE or UNKNOWN values are not selected from the result.
 
<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/a1a81c0a-61f4-4ee3-af5d-603340614428">

<br>

- Is this tuple selected? Answer: NO!

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/c9d0f784-d77f-4ceb-acf7-8cc819bc8485">

<br>

- In this case, we need to use IS NULL to check whether the salary attribute has NULL or not.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/18c5dfba-2673-4673-b6ad-b76a83e2cde1">

<br>

- Now, all tuples are selected!

<br>

# Use of JOIN Operators

- SQL permits users to specify join operators in FROM clause; This is easier to understand than mixing together select and join conditions in WHERE;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/e68c285a-0c1c-458a-a8bf-1ed6862ede04">

<br>

## Nested Queries (= Subqueries)

- A query that is part of another query is called a subquery (or nested query);
- Subquery can have many nested subquries as we want;
- There are many other ways that subqury can be used;
  - (1) Subquery can return constant value(s), and this value can be compared with another value in WHERE clause;
  - (2) Subquery can return relation (a set of tuples) that can be used in various ways in WHERE clause;
  - (3) Subquery can have their relations appear in FROM clause;
 
<br>

- A nested query can be specified within the WHERE-clause of another query, called the outer query
- Single query :

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/25294122-2969-4371-8f9d-cccf76c69830">

<br>

- Nested Query : Having executed nested query returns ‘research’ number; Then, outer query returns SSN(s) only if its DNO is equal to result of nested query.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/6a208b6d-f852-4584-bdea-4339f44f9876">

<br>

- Question: What if there are more than one research dept numbers?

<br>

### Nested Queries : IN

- A nested query can be compared with outer query by using IN operator;
- (v IN V ) compares a value v (in outer query) with the value(s) V (in nested query), and returns “true” if v is included in V. Otherwise, return “false”;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/3ed3bb03-84db-4651-8638-65647f6cc4d8">

<br>

- SQL allows use of (sub)tuples of values in comparisons by placing them within parenthesis;
- Get SSNs of employees who work for the same (project, hours) on some project that employee with SSN = ‘123456789’ works on;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/bd9106b9-bf87-4ab4-8498-f3b8222441ef">

<br>

- Get names of employees who work for the same (project, hours) on some project that employee with SSN = ‘123456789’ works on;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/85336b65-57d8-421e-89c6-a64b842438e9">

<br>

### Nested Queries : NOT IN

- (v NOT IN V ) compares a value v (in outer query) with the value(s) V (in nested query), and returns “true” if v is not included in V. Otherwise, return “false”;
- Retrieve names of employees with no dependents.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/27e60754-c293-451f-aca7-64ea7194f4cc">

<br>

- Retrieve names of employees whose names are neither Smith nor Jones.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/b757a5dd-211d-4d82-b856-0aa2f735f657">

<br>

### Nested Queries : Use of Tuple Variables

- Nested Queries also can use tuple variables;
- Retrieve names of employees who have a dependent with the same sex as the employees.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/a5c5a294-c18a-43f7-9602-4ebf5a6e6791">

<br>

### Nested Queries : SOME (= ANY)

- SOME (= ANY) can be used with {<, >, =, <=, >=, <>} operators:
  - For example, (v > SOME V ) returns “true” if the value v is greater than some of the values in a set V.
- Get SSNs of employees whose salary is greater than salary of some employees in department 5:

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/1075f738-ab30-41e6-8eff-8fb638e7b4ee">

<br>

#### Example : Meaning of SOME

- Example
  - (5 < SOME {0, 5, 7} ) = true ) = false
  - (5 <> SOME {0, 5, 7}) = true
  - (5 < SOME {1, 3, 5}
  - (5 = SOME {0, 5, 7} ) = true
- 참조: (= SOME)은 IN 과 동일한 표현임. 반면에, (<> SOME)은 NOT IN 과 동일하지 않음.

<br>

### Nested Queries : ALL

- ALL can be used with {<, >, =, <=, >=, <>} operators:
  - For example, (v > ALL V ) returns “true” if the value v is greater than all the values in a set V
- Get SSNs of employees whose salary is greater than salary of all the employees in department 5:

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/d5c4fe99-489f-4cb1-9401-c9aff2381773">

<br>

#### Example : Meaning of ALL

- Example
  - (5 < ALL {0, 5, 6} ) = false) = true
  - (5 <> ALL {4, 6, 8} ) = true
  - (5 > ALL {0, 3, 4}
  - (5 = ALL {4, 5, 7} ) = false
- 참조: (<> ALL)은 NOT IN 과 동일한 표현임. 반면에, (= ALL)은 IN 과 동일하지 않음.

<br>

### Nested Queries : EXISTS

- EXISTS(Q) returns “true” if there is at least one tuple (= not empty) in the result of a nested query Q. Otherwise, it returns “false”
- Retrieve SSNs of employees who have dependent(s).

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/8b818424-3c0c-4778-8167-f49912ebdf23">

<br>

- Retrieve names of employees who have a dependent with the same sex as the employees

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/2a1d1573-972c-47fa-ba4c-34538bfc0430">

<br>

### Nested Queries : NOT EXISTS

- NOT EXISTS(Q) returns “true” if there no tuple (= empty) in the result of a nested query Q. Otherwise, it returns “false”.
- Retrieve SSNs of employees who have no dependent.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/add2a856-0afa-4f69-8ae0-a08cd1f260eb">

<br>

- Retrieve names of employees whose sex are not the same with any dependent or with no dependent.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/59ed666a-5241-45f5-aea3-da7ba4189f4a">

<br>

- Retrieve names of employees whose salary are greater than salary of all the employees with age < 25.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/871ff282-d29c-4483-b725-18973cb946db">

<br>

- Question: Suppose that age of all employees are >= 25; Then, what is the query result?

<br>

### Division Query : NOT EXISTS and EXCEPT

- Retrieve name of each employee who work on all the projects controlled by department 5.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/6931b09d-32d4-4d87-9439-d0f532bda188">
