# Aggregate Functions

- Aggregate Functions
  - COUNT : count the number of values
  - SUM : sum of values
  - AVG : average of values
  - MAX : maximum of values
  - MIN : minimum of values
 
<br>

## GROUP BY

- We want to apply the aggregate functions to subgroups of tuples in a relation
- **GROUP BY** partitions the table into disjoint groups of tuples based on grouping attributes(s).
- Each group consists of the set of tuples that have the same value for the grouping attribute(s)
- We can then apply the aggregate function to each group independently.
- The grouping attributes must also appear in **SELECT**-clause.

<br>

- For each department, retrieve DNO, number of employees in the department, and their average salary

<br>

<br>

- Each employee group has the same value for the grouping attribute DNO.
- Note : Group attribute ‘DNO’ must appear in SELECT clause
- COUNT and AVG functions are applied to each such group.

<br>

- For each project, retrieve the project number, project name, and the number of employees who work on that project.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/246878cd-b443-4c3e-9582-0eab3b777591">

<br>

- In this case, a join condition is used together with grouping.
- The grouping and functions are applied after the joining of the two relations.

- If null values exist in the grouping attribute, then separate group is created for all tuples with a NULL value for the grouping attribute.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/309d4f3f-f043-4377-bce6-72b713d2c6e7">

<br>

## HAVING

- Sometimes, we want to retrieve the values of these functions for only those groups that satisfy certain conditions
- **HAVING** is used for specifying a selection condition on groups. (rather than on individual tuples)
- For each project on which more than two employees work, retrieve the project number, project name, and the number of employees who work on that project.

<br>

<br>

### HAVING, GROUP BY and Nested Queries

- Find the project number with the highest average working hours.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/803a437f-a519-4abc-b8a3-671a44d17828">

<br>

- SQL cannot compose of aggregate functions (function of a function),so it must be written in a certain way.

<br>

## ORDER BY

- **ORDER BY** is used to sort the tuples in a query result based on the values of some attribute(s);
- **ASC** (usually, omitted) : increasing order
- **DESC** : decreasing order

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/08670209-32d5-48ff-98a9-f827307fdfdb">

<br>

# Summary of SQL Queries

- SQL Query consists of 6 clauses. [ ] is optional.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/2dfd52e2-7122-499c-b2f9-1a75d02fef92">

<br>

- Order of query is evaluated conceptually as follows:
  - First, evaluate the FROM-clause,
  - Then, evaluate the WHERE-clause,
  - Then, GROUP BY and HAVING, and
  - Finally, the SELECT-clause
- However, this method may be inefficient in real systems;
  - Each DBMS has its own query optimization;
 
<br>

# INSERT

- **Single** tuple Insertion

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/bad741d4-8a16-4939-af76-3fe50a06b003">

<br>

- Attribute value들은 table에 정의된 attribute들의 순서와 일치가 되어야 함.
- **Multiple** tuples Insertion

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/bfdaaa96-ef54-472c-976e-533d47f6ea03">

<br>

- 이 경우 SELECT query 결과를 저장하기 위한 새로운 임시 table (**CREATE TABLE**을 이용)를 미리 만들어 야 함.

<br>

## INSERT : Single Tuple

- Insert a new project tuple into PROJECT table;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/488bc7ed-3507-46d1-b401-e067620b3880">

<br>

- Insert another new project tuple into PROJECT table;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/f5ce10f4-6b9b-47eb-89a8-bcdcf32573c5">

<br>

- 단, 이 project의 location은 알려지지 않았음
- 이 경우 각 값들과 상응하는 attribute들을 명시해야 함.

<br>

## INSERT : Multiple Tuples

- Insert DEPT tuples with the name, number of employees, and total salaries for each department; In this case, we have to prepare a temporary table.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/bbd1cc67-1b2e-481f-926a-4643116fdc97">

<br>

- We can now query DEPT-INFO as any other tables;
- Note that if we update the tuples in EMP or DEPT, DEPT-INFO may not be up-to-date.

<br>

# DELETE

- Removes tuple(s) from a table.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/2c28992d-ba86-4cc8-b7e3-dad958882e49">

<br>

- A missing WHERE-clause specifies that all tuples in the table are to be deleted;
  - The table then becomes an empty, but the table itself still exists;
- Tuples are deleted from only one table at a time. (unless CASCADE is specified on a referential constraint)
- Referential integrity should be verified.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/5a5dfc55-8230-4752-a1cb-072a8f7c5ea5">

<br>

- All employees tuples in ‘research’ department are deleted.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/f60b96ef-064c-450e-8ba5-bac6e78b4db0">

<br>

- All employee tuples are deleted, but, the EMP table itself (= definition) still exists

<br>

# UPDATE

- Used to modify attribute values of one or more selected tuples
- **WHERE**-clause selects the tuples to be modified.
- **SET**-clause specifies the attributes to be modified and their new values
- Each update command modifies tuples in a single relation.
- If primary key value is modified, referential constraints should be verified
- Change the location and controlling department number of project number 10 to ‘Chicago' and 5, respectively.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/11a5505a-306d-4135-aa46-28c76716b45b">

<br>

- Give employees in the ‘research' department a 10% raise in salary.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/7d9c4f80-341e-432c-9d26-7be648b621dd">

<br>

- Salary column on the right side of = refers to the old SALARY value before update.
- SALARY column on the left side of = refers to the new SALARY value after update

<br>

# View

- A view is a **single** table that is derived from other table(s);
- These other tables can be **base tables**, or previously defined **views**;
- A view is defined using **CREATE VIEW** as follows;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/1df77aac-0e9b-427c-99b1-5a4ad9be877f">

<br>

- We can define a view as a table that we reference “frequently”;
- A view is considered a **virtual table** because view does not necessary physically exists;
- The view is realized at request time for querying the view.

<br>

## Views : From Single Table

- We only want to keep information with SSN, name, salary, and age of employees with high salaried (say, > $50,000) employees. (We don’t want about all salaries.)

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/1ee231c5-357c-4d48-9734-f3201a957cd1">

<br>

### Querying Views

- The view “High-Sal-EMP” does not contain tuples in the usual sense. Rather, if we query this view, the corresponding tuples are obtained from the base table “EMP”.
- Retrieve the names of high salaried employees with age < 45.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/683111a2-ee82-44b9-9a87-81a1457f11ca">

<br>

- This query is translated into underlying base table as follows.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/4d70a4b8-071c-4328-922a-e2cfffffda58">

<br>

- As a result, we can ask the same query about “High-Sal-EMP” twice or more, we may get different answers, because base table “EMP” may have changed in the interim.

<br>

## Views : From Multiple Tables

- We only want to keep information with DNO, dept. name, number of employees, and total salary for each department;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/21d0db81-98db-4f4d-8327-d7811ed9f6eb">

<br>

- Note: COUNT(*), SUM(salary) are renamed as no-of-emps, total-sal.

<br>

- We only want to keep WORK-ON information with employee name, project name, and hours.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/253f536c-9d46-4ad0-a0b5-b71f98a6c673">

<br>

## Advantages of Views

- By using views, we can specify queries “more concisely”.
- Retrieve names of employees who work on the project ‘notebook’:

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/22dd534d-d3e0-4bee-b938-edef9022198d">

<br>

- This query is equivalent to the following query;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/c930b0ce-036a-4b5b-9723-5fea8de1d04e">

<br>

- In case of not using view, we need to specify two joins on the base tables; This is more complex!

<br>

- Retrieve the number of working employees and total salary for department 5.

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/b2a7ef5f-6452-4e0d-98d8-e79c4880d405">

<br>

## Modifying Views

-  Sometimes, users need to modify (insert, delete, update) views;
  - Insert a new tuple into a view
  - Delete some tuple from a view
  - Update some tuple from a view
- Is it possible to modify views? (Note : Views does not exist physically, but base table does.
  - Answer : Yes, but only for some cases; Very restricted!
- For simple views (called, “**updatable** views”), it is possible to translate the modification of the view into equivalent modification on the underlying base table.

<br>

- Consider the following view;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/9ddba41d-1ef1-48a7-a40e-b3e3ba1d0fa4">

<br>

- Increase salary for high salaried employees with age >= 60 by 5%.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/e5dad6f0-2498-4ec0-a398-428c8e2318d9">

<br>

- Is this view update possible? “Yes”, because we can actually modify base table EMP through the view; Thus, this view update is translated as follows;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/d0135a25-e197-4aad-a211-7c29f894804b">

<br>

- Consider the following view;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/79c47577-530e-4099-a0b7-707e1cbfb0c5">

<br>

- Delete all high salaried employees with salary >= 100,000.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/eef18d85-8617-46db-8444-8639d6a29c1e">

<br>

- Is this view update possible? “Yes”, because we can actually modify base table EMP through the view; Thus, this view update is translated as follows;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/86a4a483-4807-4ccf-8c66-eba3d29a9e17">

<br>

- Consider the following view;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/98127619-e7f6-45b9-baef-daf10cc68ead">

<br>

- Insert a new high salaried employee as follows;

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/ff382f01-ad78-4456-8f68-fc653c0ebdcc">

<br>

- Is this view update possible? “No”. Why? This view update is translated as follows; But this insertion is impossible, because primary key SSN has a NULL value.

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/07928eac-f544-4af3-8cbc-d20b5c3cb21c">

<br>

## View Update : Multiple Tables

- Update bob’s current project name from ‘printer’ to ‘laptop’.

![Uploading image.png…]()

<br>

- Is view update possible? No! It has two possible translations:
  - 1) Find bob’s current PNO (say, p1), then find its pname (say, printer), then, change it by ‘laptop’ or
  - 2) Find laptop’s PNUM (say, p3) and then find bob’s current working project (say, printer, p1), and then, change it by ‘p3’.
- This view update is ambiguous because it can not be translated uniquely:
- DBMS seems not smart to decide which one is better! In this example, option 2) looks better.

<br>

## Un-updatable Views

- View update는 일반적으로 다음의 경우에는 update 불가.
  - Aggregate 함수(sum, avg, group by 등)를 사용한 view
  - 2 개 이상의 table들로 (join 등을 이용) 부터 유도된 view
  - View의 SELECT clause에 Primary key가 명시되지 않은 경우
  - 기타의 경우 : 사례별로 봐야 함.
- We can specify with CHECK option:
  - Must be added to the view definition if the view can be updated
  - To allow check for updatability and to plan for an execution strategy

<br>

## View Implementation

(1) **Query Modification** (Most widely used)

- A view is not physically stored.
- Present the view query in terms of a query on the underlying base tables
- A view is computed at the time users specify a query on the view.
- DBMS must modify the user’s view query into a query on its underlying base tables.
- Query processing is inefficient for views defined via complex queries:
- Especially if additional queries are to be applied to the view within a short time period

<br>

(2) View Materialization

- A view is pre-computed and physically stored as keeping a temporary table.
- When a query is requested on the view, the unmodified query is executed directly on the pre-computed result.
- This is much faster than query modification; Faster access for expensive and complex joins
- Support applications that do not require current data or require data valid at a specific point in time (snapshot data).
- A major drawback is that we must maintain the consistency between the base table and the view when the base table is updated; Cost of maintaining view is high!
