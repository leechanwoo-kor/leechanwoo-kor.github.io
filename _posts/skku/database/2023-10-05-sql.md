# SQL

- Initially, SEQUEL language (System R) project at IBM
- Three relational languages : QUEL, QBE, SQL
- (Later renamed) Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Currently, Standard Relational database Language
  - Users need to be less concerned to migrate to other types of relational DBMS
- Very-High-level language
  - Declarative (= Non-procedural) language
  - Users do not need to specify how (= what order of) to execute query operations.
  - Say “what to do” rather than “how to do”
  - Relational algebra is a procedural language.
 
<br>

- Table (= relation), row (= tuple), column (= attribute)
- A table consists of :
  - Base Table
  - View (= Virtual table)
- Basic commands;
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - Data Control Language (DCL)
- DDL is used for defining schemas, tables, and views.
  - CREATE, DROP, ALTER
- DML is used for retrieving and modifying tuples in a table.
  - SELECT (FROM WHERE)
  - INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
 
<br>

# CREATE TABLE

A table is defined using CREATE TABLE command:

<br>

<br>

- A relation defined by CREATE TABLE is called a “base table”.
  - The relation (and its tuples) are “physically stored”.
  - All created tables are initially “empty”.
  - Attributes are ordered as they are specified in CREATE TABLE
 
<br>

## Constraints

- Key Integrity
  - Primary key and keys can be specified by PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE, respectively
- Entity Integrity
  - This must be specified by NOT NULL on PRIMARY KEY
  - NOT NULL also optionally can be specified on other attributes.
    - : For example, employee names, phone may be specified by non null; What if new employee’s name is unknown?
- Referential Integrity
  - This is specified by FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES
  - SQL’s default action is to reject the operation that violates referential integrity violation
  - SQL also provides user specified trigger action
 
<br>

## Key/Entity Constraints

## Referential Constraint

<br>

## Trigger

- SQL provides the following “Referential Trigger Action”;

<br>

<img width="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/39dfd90c-991a-439f-b930-2715b37ae18d">

<br>

- Total 6 trigger actions possible; For example:
  - (1) ON UPDATE CASCADE
    - : Change the value of referencing FK to the updated (new) PK value for all the referencing tuples;
  - (2) ON DELETE CASCADE
    - : Delete all the referencing tuples;
  - (3) ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT
  - (4) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
    - : The value of FK in referencing tuples is changed to default value;
  - (5) ON UPDATE SET NULL
  - (6) ON DELETE SET NULL
    - : The value of FK in referencing tuples is changed to NULL value;
   
<br>

- Note : This SET NULL option is not allowed if the FK in referencing relation is a part of its own primary key.
- It is the responsibility of database designer to specify appropriate trigger actions.
- In general, CASCADE is useful for following “relationship” relations.
  - binary relationships (i.e., WORK-ON)
  - weak entity types (i.e., DEPENDENT)
  - multi-valued attributes (i.e., DEPT_LOCATIONS)

<br>

# DROP TABLE

- Used to remove a relation (base table) and its definition
- The dropped table can no longer be used in queries, updates, or any other commands since it does no longer exist.
- Two DROP options: CASCADE and RESTRICT
- Example:

**DROP TABLE DEPENDENT RESTRICT**

- This table is removed only if it is not referenced in any constraints or view. Otherwise, the DROP command will not be executed.
- For example, by foreign keys in another tables or views

**DROP TABLE DEPENDENT CASCADE**

- All constraints and views that reference this table are also removed automatically

<br>

# ALTER TABLE

- Used to add or drop columns and change column definition to an existing table.

- Example:

**ALTER TABLE EMP ADD COLUMN hobby CHAR(12)**

- The new column ‘hobby’ will have NULLs in all tuples if no default value is specified.
- Users must enter a value for ‘hobby’ column by using UPDATE command.

**ALTER TABLE EMP DROP COLUMN bdate CASCADE**

- All constraints and views that ‘bdate’ column are also dropped automatically.
- If RESTRICT is used, this command is executed only if no views or constraints reference ‘bdate’ column.
