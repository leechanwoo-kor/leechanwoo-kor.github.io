# The Big Picture

- Datasets are often large and complex so drawing all of them into a single static view can be overwhelming.
- What options are available to handle such complexity? There are **five**.
  - **1. Change a view over time (this lecture)**
  - 2. Derive new data (Lecture 3)
  - **3. Facet data by partitioning into multiple juxtaposed views (this lecture)**
  - 4. Reduce the amount of data (next lecture)
  - 5. Embed focus and context information within a single view (next lecture)

# Change View over Time

- Changing the view over time is the most obvious, popular, and flexible choice in vis design.
- Unavailable in printed visualizations
- Let users modify the view.
  - Change the encoding
  - Change the arrangement
  - Change the order
  - Change the viewpoint
  - Change which attributes are filtered
  - Change the aggregation level
  - $\dots$
 
<br>

## Changing the Encoding

- Tableau
- Encoding
- Arrangement
- Mark type/size/color
- $\dots$

<br>

## Changing the Order

- Reordering, often called sorting, is a powerful choice for finding patterns in a dataset by interactively changing the attribute that is used to order the data.
- Widely-used for table datasets
  - Order by student_id, order by score, â€¦
- What if there are multiple attributes that can be used for sorting?

<br>

## Example: LineUp

- Designed to support exploration of tables with many attributes through interactive reordering and realigning.

- Order universities by 0.25 * (Research) + 0.25 * (Citations) + $\dots$
  - Multiattribute ordering
- Changing the alignment and arrangement of stacked bars:
