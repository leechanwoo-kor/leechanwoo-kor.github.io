## 2 Design a Visualization Interface

Design a visualization interface that helps the user to explore the dataset. Provide a lowfidelity prototype of your interface. You can sketch the interface using a pen and paper or you can use a slide editing tool (e.g., PowerPoint) to make a wireframe. Explain the interface.

What information does each visualization in the interface show? How can the user interact with the visualizations?

Report the following:
- Attach a sketch of the design.
- What mark type and channels are used for each visualization?
- Which tasks does each visualization support?
- How does the user interact with the visualizations?
- Try to describe the interface using the terms we learned from the lecture as much as possible.
