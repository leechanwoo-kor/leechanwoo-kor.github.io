# Visualization

- What is visualization (**시각화**, 가시화)?
- Visualization: Creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message.
- Sometimes, we visualiza something intangible or abstract.
  - e.g., love, happiness, information

Sheet music **visuallizes** a musical work.

# Data Visualization

- then, what is data visualization?
  - Of course, it is a visualization of data.
- Charts, graphs, figures, tables, ...
- We need to find an **effective mapping** between data attributes and visual properties of symbols.

<br>

## Data Visualization Example

### Why Interactive “Data” Visualization?

- Data is abundant and growing rapidly.
  - Data storages are getting cheaper!
  - Scalable data processing technologies: cloud/parallel/distributed computing
- Gaining insights from the abundant amount of data
  - Finding relationships, discover structures, identify pattens/outliers, tell a story, …
  - Decision making
  - Needle in haystack?
 
<br>

- However, our perceptual and cognitive abilities are relatively constant!
- We need support!
  - The use of external representation
  - Visualization provides one means of combating information overload.

<br>

### Why Interactive Data “Visualization”?

- Sensing stimuli from outside: human sensory organs
  - Eyes (vision): 10,000,000 bps (1.25 MB/sec)
  - Skin (touch, tactition ): 1,000,000 bps
  - Ears (hearing, audition): 100,000 bps
  - Nose (smell, olfaction): 100,000 bps
  - Mouth (taste, gustation): 1,000 bps
- From The Nervous System in the Context of Information Theory

<br>

- Static visualization vs interactive visualization
- Data are too complex to be shown in a single static view.
- More views / dimensions / analytic methods

<br>

### Statistics?

- We have many statistical methods to summarize data. Do we really need visualization?

# Information Visualization ( InfoVis)

- In a board sense, it is visualization of information.
  - Sometimes, interchangeable with data visualization.
- In a narrow sense, we have several concrete definitions of InfoVis Data

<br>

## Definitions of InfoVis

> InfoVis is the use of computer supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition.
> by Stuart Card, Jock Mackinlay, Ben Shneiderman, 1999

**Other Definitions of InfoVis**

> Visual representations of the semantics, or meaning, of information. In contrast to scientific visualization, information visualization typically deals with nonnumeric, nonspatial, and high dimensional data.
> by Chen, 2005

> A method of presenting data or information in non traditional, interactive graphical forms. By using 2 D or 3 D color graphics and animation, these visualizations can show the structure of information, allow one to navigate through it, and modify it with graphical interactions.
> UIUC DLI, 1998

---

- These definitions differ in detail, but they agree with several important concepts about InfoVis

- InfoVis is about abstract data.
- It involves humans
- It involves computers
- It involves visual representations
- it involves interactions

<br>

# What is abstract Data?

- Scientific Visualization (SciVis)
  - Data are typically physically based.
  - Spatial representations are given (e.g., 2D or 3D).
- Information Visualization (InfoVis)
  - Do not have a “natural” mapping to spatial representations.

<br>

## Scientific Visualization Examples

<br>

## SciVis or InfoVis?

- Is spatialization given (SciVis) or chosen (InfoVis)
- Good reference: “Information and Scientific Visualization: Separate but Equal or Happy Together at Last (IEEE VIS 03)”

<br>

# What's Beyond a Bar Chart?

- Visualization is just not a matter of implementing simple charts. It involves
  - User & data & task analysis
  - Perceptually effective designs
  - Efficient implementation (e.g., scalablity)
  - Responsive interaction
  - Usability
  - Evaluation (based on methodologies from HCI)

<br>

## Example Questions

- How can we visualize data that is too large to process in a few seconds?
- How can we design a visualization automatically?
- How can we visualize data that has high dimensionality (> 5)?
- How can we visualize on mobile devices?
- How can we visualize data that changes over time?
- How can we visualize the inner workings of AI models?
- How can we visually compare two text documents?
- $\dots$
