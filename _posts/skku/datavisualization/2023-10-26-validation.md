# Vis Design

- Your boss: "Develop a vis interface for this data."
- What you do:
  - Get the data
  - Get some examples and libraries on the Web
  - Implement and customize your visualization
  - You in the next meeting: "This is our vis interface."
- This is what many data scientists actually do in their company.

- Problems:
  - You cannot answer "Why is yours effective?"
  - You cannot answer "Why is yours better than other designs?"
  - You cannot evaluate your vis quantitatively nor qualitatively.
- Why this happened? **Because you didn't define the problem to solve using vis.**
- How can we design and validate a vis crrectly?
