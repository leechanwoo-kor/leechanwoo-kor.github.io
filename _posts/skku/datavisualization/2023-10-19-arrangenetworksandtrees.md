# Networks and Trees

- A **network** (or graph) is made up of nodes and links and specifies the relationship between two or more nodes.
  - Trees do not have cycles.
- Nodes and links can have attributes independently.
- Example: social network on Facebook
  - Node: accounts (people, organizations, or pages)
  - Link: friendship (or subscription)
  - Node attributes: name, photo, website_url, ...
  - Link attributes: last interaction time, ...

<br>

## Network Visualization in InfoVis

- Network visualization is one of the oldest research areas in InfoVis.
- Flight network
- Road network (junctions and roads)
- World Wide Web
- Social networks
- Biological pathways
- Bitcoin Transactions
- Artificial Neural Networks

<br>

# Two Families of Visualization

- **Node link diagram**
  - Uses the connection channels
- **Adjacency Matrix**
- The big question: which is better?
  - Scalability
  - Effectiveness
  - Interactivity

<br>

## Node Link Diagram

- In a node link diagram, nodes are drawn as point marks and the links connecting them are drawn as line marks.
- Triangular vertical node link layout
- Spline radial layout

<br>

<br>

### Vertical Node-Link Layout

- Root on the top
- Leaves on the bottom
- Vertial spatial position shows **depth**
- Horizon tal spatial position does not encode an attribute.
  - Chosen by a layout algorithm

<br>

<br>

### Horizontal Node-Link Layout

- Word Tree

<br>

### Radial Layout

- The distance away from the center shows **depth**
- Vertical & horizontal spatial positions are chosen by a layout algorithm to avoid overlap.

<br>

<br>

### Scalability

- The na√Øve node-link diagrams are useful for a tree with a few hundred nodes.
- For bigger trees, we need aggregate edges.

<br>

### Networks

- What tasks do users want to perforn on graphs?
  - Task taxonomy of graph visualization
- **Topology-based tasks** (can be well supported by node link diagrams)
  - Find the set of nodes adjacent to a node.
  - How many nodes are adjacent to a node?
- **Attribute-based tasks**
  - Find the nodes having a specific attribute value.
- **Browsing tasks**
  - Follow a given path.
- See Lee et al., ‚ÄúTask taxonomy for graph visualization‚Äù for more details.

# Graph Drawing

- **Graph drawing** is a research area that aims to find a ‚Äúgood‚Äù 2D dep i ction of networks.
- What is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù network layout? (= quality measures)
  - Minimize the number of **edge crossings**
  - Display the **symmetries** of the graph
  - Minimize the **number of bends** along the edges
  - Maximize the smallest **angle between two edges** incident on the same vertex
  - Minimize the **sum of edge length** and the **maximum length of an edge**
  - Minimize the **area of the drawing** by producing a compact graph
  - ‚Ä¶
 
<br>

- Many graph drawing algorithms are NP complete and seem not to have a polynomial time algorithm.
- So, we use **approximation** instead.
- **Force-directed graph drawing** is a class of algorithms that are based on a physical model
  - We define forces among the set of nodes/links.
  - We find a layout with minimum energy by simulating the movements of nodes/edges.
 
<br>

# What are the ‚ÄúForces‚Äù?

- Attractive forces are applied to
  - the two endpoints of an edge toward each other
  - all nodes toward the center of the viewbox
- Repulsive forces are applied to
  - each pair of nodes that are not neighbors
  - Forces applied to a node are summed up and used to compute the next position of the node (after a very small fraction of time = simulation)
 
<br>

# Force-Directed Layout

1. Assign random initial positions to nodes
2. Compute the force applied to each node
3. Compute dx and dy
4. Slightly move the nodes towards dx , dy
5. Repeat 2-4 until the layout is stabilized (equilibrium state).

<br>

- Strengths:
  - Good quality
  - Easy to implement
  - Intuitive
  - Flexible
  - Interactive
- Weaknesses:
  - Non-deterministic
    - spatial memory cannot be exploited across different runs of the algorithm
  - Scalability (hairball)
  - Poor local minima
  - Continual bouncing
 
<br>

- The Hairball Problem

## Toward Better Scalability

- Multilevel scalable force directed placement (sfdp)
- Generate simplified graphs: ùê∫ 0 ùê∫ 1 ùê∫ ùëô
  - Graph coarsening
  - Edge collapsing
- Place ùê∫ ùëô
- Use ùê∫ ùëò 1 to place ùê∫ ùëò
- For more information, see ‚ÄúEfficient, High Quality Force Directed Graph Drawing‚Äù by Yifan Hu.

## DeepDrawing

- Traditional graph drawing algorithms take long time.
- Sometimes we need to run the algorithm several times to obtain a desired layout (by tuning some parameters)
- Can we accelerate this process using deep learning?
- Wang et al., ‚ÄúDeepDrawing : A Deep Learning Approach to Graph Drawing‚Äù(TVCG 2019)

<br>

# Adjacency Matrix

- All of the **nodes** in the network are laid out along the vertical and horizontal edges of a square region.
- **Links** between two nodes are indicated by coloring an area mark in the cell in the matrix that is the intersection between their row and column.
- Additional information about nodes and edges can be encoded by coloring matrix.
  - e.g., cluster of nodes
- The matrix becomes **symmetric** for an undirected graph.

# Node-link Diagram vs Adjacency Matrix

![image](https://github.com/leechanwoo-kor/leechanwoo-kor.github.io/assets/55765292/6322a30c-f34b-44ce-9f03-837a5efc5f54)

<br>

# NodeTrix Idiom

- Node-link diagrams are good for revealing the global structure.
- Adjacency matrices are good for revealing the local structure.
- Can we use both at the same time?
  - Social network data: globally sparse and locally dense
- Nathalie Henry, Jean Daniel Fekete, and Michael J. McGuffin, ‚Äú NodeTrix : A Hybrid Visualization of Social Networks‚Äù (InfoVis 2007)

<br>

- Identify communities
- Identify central actors

# Enclosure

- **Containment marks** can be used to visualize the hierarchiy in data.
- Only works for trees (no cycles)

<br>

<br>

## Treemaps

- The hierarchical relationships are shown with containment rather than connection.
- All of the children of a tree node are enclosed within the area allocated that node, creating a nested layout.
- The size of the nodes is mapped to some attribute of the node.

### Neighborhood Preserving Treemaps

- Can we reflect the neighborhood relationship in a Treemap layout?
- Duarte et al., ‚ÄúNmap: A Novel Neighborhood Preservation Space filling Algorithm‚Äù (InfoVis 2014)
  - e.g., cities in Korea have a hierarchy
    - Korea
      - Seoul
        - ‚Ä¶
      - Gyeonggi do
        - Suwon si
        - Yongin si

<br>

### GrouseFlocks

- Compound network: a network + tree
- Cluster hierarchy atop original network.
- Connection marks for original network, containment marks for cluster hierarchy.
