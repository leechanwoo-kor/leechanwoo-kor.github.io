# 1. Patterns and Pattern Classes

- Each flower is described by two measurements(petal length, width)

# 2. Recognition Based on Decision-Theoretic Methods

- Decision-theoretic approaches to recognition are based on the use of decision functions.
- Let $x = (x_1,x_2, \dots, x_n)^T$ represent an n-dimensional pattern vector. For $W$ pattern classes $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_w$, we want to find $W$ decision functions $d_1(x), d_2(x), \dots, d_W(x)$ with the property that if a pattern $x$ belongs to class, then
  - $d_i(x) > d_j(x), j=1,2,\dots,W; j \neq i$
- The decision boundary separating class $\omega_i$ and $omega_j$ is ...
