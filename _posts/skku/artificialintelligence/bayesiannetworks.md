# Bayesian Networks

<br>

## Introduction

<br>

### Boolean Random Variables

- We deal with the simplest type of random variables – Boolean ones
- Take the values *true* or *false*
- Think of the event as occurring or not occurring
- Examples (Let *A* be a Boolean random variable):

A = Getting heads on a coin flip
A = It will rain today
A = There is a typo in these slides

<br>

### Probability : Random Variables

- A **random variable** is the basic element of probability
- Refers to an event and there is some degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of the event
- For example, the random variable A could be the event of getting a heads on a coin flip

### Bayesian Networks

- Bayesian networks help us reason with uncertainty
- In the opinion of many AI researchers, Bayesian networks are the most significant contribution in AI in the last 10 years
- They are used in many applications e. g :
  – Spam filtering / Text mining
  – Speech recognition
  – Robotics
  – Diagnostic systems
