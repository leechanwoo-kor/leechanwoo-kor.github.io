# Problem Solving

- The 8-Puzzle:
  - 3 x 3 board with eight numbered tiles and a blank space

- Assign a decimal digit to each of the letter in such a way thatanswer to the problem is correct.
- If the same letter occurs more than once, it must be assigned same digit each time.
- No two different letters may be assigned same digit

<br>

# 2.1 Well-defined problems and solution

- Basic elements of a problem definition: states and actions
  - Initial state
  - **Operator**: description of an action in terms of which state will be reached by carrying out the action in a particular state
  - **Goal test**: agent can apply a single state description to determine if it is a goal state.
    - explicit set of possible goal states
    - specified by abstract property
  - **Path cost function**: a function that assigns a cost to a path

- State space: set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions.
- Path: any sequence of actions leading one state to another.
- Solution : a path from the initial state to goal state

# 2.2 Example Problems

## The 8-Puzzle

: 3 x 3 board with eight numbered tiles and a blank space

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55765292/222054652-ede556f8-7c0e-4574-a1fc-d0100261a202.png){: .align-center}

- States: a state description specifies the location of each of the eight tiles.
- Operators: blank moves left,right,up or down
- Goal test: state matches the goal configuration
- Path cost: each step costs 1. path cost is the length of the cost

<br>

**Search Tree for the 8 puzzle problem**

- States: a state description specifies the location of robot, sensory input values
- Operators: move north, south, east, west
- Goal test: state matches the goal location
- Path cost: each step costs 1 Path cost is the length of the path

## Robot in a Two Dimensional Grid World

- Boundary
- Solid object
- The robot senses whether the eight surrounding cells are free for it to occupy

- Large, unmovable objects(obstacles)
- Move from start state to the goal state avoiding obstacles
- Robot is able to sense whether or not the eight cells surrounding it are free
- Sensory inputs: s1, s2, ..., s8. Either 0 or 1, 0 if cell is free
- Four actions - move north, south, east, west

<br>

- States: a state description specifies the location of robot, sensory input values
- Operators: move north, south, east, west
- Goal test: state matches the goal location
- Path cost: each step costs 1. Path cost is the length of the path

## Travelling Salesperson Problem

- Each city must be visited exactly once.
- The aim is to find shortest path.
- In Romania Map
- State: in Oradea, visited {Arad, Sibiu}

<br>

# 2.3 Search Tree and Graph

- Find a path from Arad to Bucharest
  - initial state Arad
  - after expanding Arad
  - after expanding Sibiu

<br>

## Tree search example

- **Generating Action Sequences**
  - Apply operators to the current state => generate new set of states. : Expanding state
  - Choose a state
  - Test if this is a goal state
  - If it is not expand it.
  - Choosing → testing → Expanding
- **The choice of which state to expand first is determined by the search strategy**

<br>

- To formalize a little we can define four criteria used to measure search strategies
  - **Completeness** : Is the strategy guaranteed to find a solution?
  - **Time Complexity** : How long does it take to find a solution?
  - **Space Complexity** : How much memory does it take to perform the search?
  - **Optimality** : Does the strategy find the optimal solution where there are several solutions?

## Graph

<br>

## Graph Notation

- Consists of nodes
- Connected by arcs
- Directed arc
- Nodes: states
- Arcs: operators
- Parent node
- Child node
- Edges: undirected graph
- Directed tree: each node(except one) has exactly one parent
- Root node

<br>

- Node in the tree having no successors: leaf node
- Depth of node: 0 for root node
  - depth(node) = depth(parent) + 1
- Undirected tree is an undirected graph in which there is one and only one path along edges between any pair of nodes
- If all nodes except leaf nodes have the same number b of successors, b is called branching factor of the tree

<br>

- A sequence of nodes $(n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k)
  - Path of length $k-1$ from node $n_1$ to $n_k$
• If a path exists from node $n_i$ to $n_j$, then $n_j$ is *accessible* from node $n_i$
• C(a): cost of an arc a
• *Cost* of a path between two nodes: sum of the costs of all of the arcs connecting nodes on the path
• *Optimal path*: path having minimal cost
