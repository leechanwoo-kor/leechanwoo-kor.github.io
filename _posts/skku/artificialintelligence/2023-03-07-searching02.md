# Search Strategies

<br>

## Uninformed Search (Blind Search)
- No information about the number of steps or the path cost from the current state to the goal
- Distinguish goal state from a non goal state
- No preference among Sibiu, Timisoara, Zerind

<br>

## Informed Search (Heuristic Search)
- Since Bucharest is southeast of Arad, and Sibiu is in that direction, so it is likely to be the best choice.
- Uninformed search strategies are distinguished by the order in which nodes are expanded.

<br>

## Breadth First Search (BFS)

- Root node is expanded first
- All nodes generated by the root node are expanded next, and their successors
- All nodes at depth d in search tree are expanded before the nodes at depth $d+1$
- Considers all the paths of length 1 then all those of length 2, and so on.
- If there are several solutions, it find the shallowest goal state first
- Complete
- **Optimal** provided the path cost is a nondecreasing function of the depth of the node
- Why it is not always the strategy of choice?

<br>

- Assume branching factor is $b$
- Suppose that solution has a path length of $d$
- Maximum number of nodes expanded before finding a solution
  - $1+b+b^2+b^3+ \dots + b^d$
- Exponential complexity (Time and Space) $O(b^d)$
  - Depth $d$ =12
  - Assuming branch factor $b$ =10, 1000 nodes/second, 100 bytes/node
  - Time: 35 years, Memory: 111 tera bytes

<br>

## Uniform Cost Search

- Expand the lowest cost node measured by path cost $g(n)$
- Breadth first search is uniform cost search with $g(n)=d(n)$
- Finds cheapest solution provided that the cost of a path never decrease as we go along the path.(i.e. every operator has a nonnegative cost)

$g(Successor(n)) \geq g(n),$ for every node $n$

<br>

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Expand one of the nodes at the deepest level of the tree.
- When the search hits a dead end (a non goal node with no expansion), search go back and expand nodes at shallower levels.
- Modest memory requirements.
- $bm$ nodes
- $b$: branching factor, $m$ :maximum depth

<br>

- Time complexity $O(b^m)$
- For problems that have many solutions, depth first may be faster than breadth-first
- Get stuck: infinite depth
- Not complete
- Not optimal

### Depth-First Search with a depth-limit

<br>

## Depth-limited search

- Impose a cutoff on the maximum depth of a path
- Map of Romania, 20 cities
- Solution must be of length 19 at the longest
- Complete
- Not optimal
- If we choose depth limit that is too small,
  - Complete? Optimal?
- Time complexity $O(b^l)$
- Space complexity $O(bl)$
- $l$: depth limit

<br>

## Iterative deepening search

- Good limit?
- Any city can be reached from any other city at most 9 steps.
  - leads to a more efficient depth–limited search
- We will not know a good depth limit.
- Try all possible depth limits
- Depth 0, depth 1, depth 2,….
- Combines the benefits of depth-first and breadth-first search
- Optimal and complete

<br>

 Modest memory requirements of depth first search
- Many states are expanded multiple times
- Time complexity?
- It does not matter much that the upper levels are expanded multiple times

- Cf. Number of expansions in **depth-limited search** to depth d with branching factor b
  - $1 + b + b^2 + \dots + b^{d-2} + b^{d-1} + b^d$

<br>

- For b=10, d=5
- Cf. Depth-limited search
  - 1+10+100+1000+10,000+100,000=111,111
- Iterative deepening search, nodes on the bottom level are expanded once
- Nodes on the next to bottom level are expanded twice Root of the search tree, expanded d+1 times
- Total number of expansions
  - $(d+1)1 + (d)b + (d-1)b^2 + \dots + 3b^{d-2} + 2b^{d-1} + 1b^d$

<br>

- For b=10, d=5
- total number of expanded nodes in iterative deepening search
- 6 + 50 + 400 + 3,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 = 123,456
- 11% more nodes are expanded
- Space complexity : $O(db)$
- Time complexity : $O(b^d)$
